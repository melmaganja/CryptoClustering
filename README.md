# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, I applied my knowledge of K-means algorithms and principal component analysis to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price fluctuations across different timeframes. 
This assignment was the first time demonstrating the basis of unsupervised machine learning using Pandas. We reviewed similar concepts from other assignments such as setting indexes, creating a data frame, creating a list, using “for” loops, and visualizing the data. However, we also began to explore new concepts such as K-means, the elbow method, and using PCA data. 
This assignment was quite fun to work through. I am looking forward to continuing to develop my skills in machine learning.
